**Virtual Mouse using Eyes and Fingers**
A virtual mouse system that uses eye tracking or finger input for intuitive and precise cursor control.

**Description**
This project aims to create a virtual mouse system that allows users to control the cursor on a digital interface using eye tracking or finger input. By leveraging eye tracking technology, users can move the cursor by simply looking at different areas of the screen. Finger input provides interaction options such as clicking.

**BENIFITS:**
A virtual mouse using eye tracking technology can offer several benefits in real-world problems. Here are some ways it can be beneficial:
Accessibility: Eye tracking-based virtual mouse systems can greatly enhance accessibility for individuals with severe physical disabilities or conditions that prevent them from using traditional input devices.
Hands-free interaction: Eye tracking eliminates the need for manual input devices, enabling hands-free interaction with computers and other devices.

A virtual mouse using finger input can offer several benefits in real-world problems
Accessibility: Virtual mouse systems can enhance accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities or limitations that make it difficult to use a traditional mouse. 
Hygiene and health: In situations where hygiene is a concern, such as shared workspaces or public settings, using a virtual mouse with finger input eliminates the need to physically touch a traditional mouse
